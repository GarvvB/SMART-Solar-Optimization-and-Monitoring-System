## Overview

The **SMART Solar Optimization & Monitoring System (SOMS)** is a next-generation platform that integrates **machine learning**, **real-time analytics**, and **solar weather forecasting** to deliver comprehensive insights for solar power plants.

It enables:
- **Operational efficiency monitoring** (AC/DC scaling, inverter performance)
- **Fault detection** using intelligent pattern recognition
- **Power forecasting** based on weather predictions
- **Real-time analytics & visualization dashboard**
- **Weather-aware insights** for performance optimization

## Key Features

| Category | Feature | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| **Monitoring** | Real-time power output visualization | Displays live AC/DC readings with auto-refresh |
| **Performance Metrics** | Efficiency, temperature, fault rate, total power | Auto-calculated and calibrated dynamically |
| **Forecasting** | Predicts next-day solar output | Based on trained ML model + physics correction |
| **Weather Integration** | Uses OpenWeatherMap API *(coming soon)* | For live irradiance, temperature, and wind data |
| **Fault Detection** | ML-based inverter fault classification | Detects anomalies from DC/AC imbalance |
| **Visual Dashboard** | Interactive Streamlit UI + Plotly graphs | Gradient themes, tabs, metric cards |
| **Historical Analysis** | Insights from stored data | Identifies trends, peak performance, and efficiency loss |
